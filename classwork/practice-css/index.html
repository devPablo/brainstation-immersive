        <h2>About</h2>
        <article>
          Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland, on 28 December 1969. He is the
          son of journalists Anna and Nils Torvalds,[7] the grandson of
          statistician Leo TÃ¶rnqvist and of poet Ole Torvalds and the
          great-grandson of journalist and soldier Toivo Karanko. His parents
          were campus radicals at the University of Helsinki in the 1960s. His
          family belongs to the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland. Torvalds
          was named after Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize-winning American
          chemist, although in the book Rebel Code: Linux and the Open Source
          Revolution, Torvalds is quoted as saying, "I think I was named equally
          for Linus the Peanuts cartoon character", noting that this makes him
          half "Nobel Prize-winning chemist" and half "blanket-carrying cartoon
          character".
          <br />[8] Torvalds attended the University of Helsinki between 1988
          and 1996,[9] graduating with a master's degree in computer science
          from the NODES research group.[10] His academic career was interrupted
          after his first year of study when he joined the Finnish Navy Nyland
          Brigade in the summer of 1989, selecting the 11-month officer training
          program to fulfill the mandatory military service of Finland. He
          gained the rank of second lieutenant, with the role of an artillery
          observer.[11] Torvalds bought computer science professor Andrew
          Tanenbaum's book Operating Systems: Design and Implementation, in
          which Tanenbaum describes MINIX, an educational stripped-down version
          of Unix. In 1990, he resumed his university studies, and was exposed
          to Unix for the first time, in the form of a DEC MicroVAX running
          ULTRIX.[12] His MSc thesis was titled Linux: A Portable Operating
          System.[13] His interest in computers began with a Commodore
          VIC-20,[14] at the age of 11 in 1981, initially programming in BASIC,
          but later by directly accessing the 6502 CPU in machine code. He did
          not make use of assembly language.[15] After the VIC-20 he purchased a
          Sinclair QL, which he modified extensively, especially its operating
          system. "Because it was so hard to get software for it in Finland,
          Linus wrote his own assembler and editor (in addition to Pac-Man
          graphics libraries)"[16] for the QL, as well as a few games.[17][18]
          He wrote a Pac-Man clone named Cool Man. On 5 January 1991[19] he
          purchased an Intel 80386-based clone of IBM PC[20] before receiving
          his MINIX copy, which in turn enabled him to begin work on Linux.
